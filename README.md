# 🔐 Product Authenticity Verification System

## 🧾 Introduction

The **Product Authenticity Verification System** is designed to help consumers verify the authenticity and safety of products, especially in industries like **food**, **cosmetics**, and **pharmaceuticals**.

By leveraging **QR codes**, **cryptographic digital signatures**, and **machine learning**, this system enables users to:

- Detect counterfeit products
- Check expiration dates
- Review product ingredients

Manufacturers can dynamically register products, generate secure QR codes, and ensure real-time updates, creating a bridge of trust between brands and consumers.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **QR-Based Product Authentication**  
  Scan QR codes to confirm product originality and access essential product data.

- 🔏 **Digital Signature Verification**  
  Uses cryptographic signing to prevent tampering and ensure data integrity.

- 🏷️ **Manufacturer Dashboard**  
  Enables secure product registration and QR code generation.

- 🔄 **Real-Time Product Data**  
  Manufacturers can update product information at any time.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Integration**  
  Enhance QR scan reliability and optimize hash-based lookup and validation.

- 📱 **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Consumers receive instant feedback on product status through a clean and intuitive UI.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **Manufacturers** register their products and upload relevant information.
2. A **secure QR code** with a digital signature is generated for each product.
3. Consumers **scan the QR code** using a mobile or web app.
4. The system **validates the digital signature** and displays:
   - Product authenticity
   - Expiration status
   - Ingredient details
5. If tampering or invalid hashes are detected, users are notified immediately.
